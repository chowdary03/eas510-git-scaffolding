My interests in AI include MCP and integrating tools with LLMs to make day‑to‑day tasks easier through intelligent agents. I am also interested in generative AI, especially training transformer models for audio generation such as music.

I want to build hardware compilers that efficiently run complex AI algorithms, as I believe this skill will be in high demand across the AI industry.
