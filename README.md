AI Journey

I was first introduced to Python during my undergraduate studies, when I was asked to implement the Penman–Monteith equation in a programming language. I chose Python and continued to use it throughout several courses.

In the middle of my sixth semester, I participated in the Inter-IIT Technical Competition, where our challenge was to automate an industrial task. That project gave me my first hands-on exposure to machine learning. Afterward, my curiosity grew: I self-studied, completed comprehensive playlists on machine learning and deep learning, and built small projects to understand how different models work. In my final year, I completed a deep learning project using LSTM–CNN models on 13 years of raw data.

After graduation, I joined a service-based company in Pune, where I was introduced to large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). I had the opportunity to both learn and lead projects, including building AI chatbots, designing agents, conducting R&D, and evaluating RAG tools.

I am now pursuing a master’s degree in AI to formalize my knowledge and to focus on applying AI for social good.
